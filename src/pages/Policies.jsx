              At SEPIYAR, customer satisfaction is paramount to us. Our policies
              are designed to ensure that every client receives the best

            <p>
              All permanent cosmetic procedures involve multiple sessions. To
              achieve optimal results, we recommend clients return for one
              enhancement session approximately 5-10 weeks after their initial
              appointment. During this session, we assess color retention and
              make any necessary adjustments. This enhancement session is
              crucial and must be completed before finalizing your procedure.
              Healing outcomes vary for each client and depend on adherence to
              post-care instructions.

            <p>
              SEPIYAR accepts major credit cards, debit cards, and cash. We do
              not accept checks or money orders. To secure your appointment, a
              100% non-refundable deposit is required through our online booking
              system. This deposit confirms your commitment and will be deducted
              from your total cost. The remaining balance will be charged on the
              day of your appointment. Please note that our booking system
              mandates a deposit to confirm all appointments.

              Late cancellations, rescheduling, and "No Shows" create gaps in

              which is why these policies are necessary.

            <p>
              No cancellations or changes are permitted within 48 hours of your
              cosmetic tattooing appointment. For Brow Styling, Brow Lamination,
              and Lash Lamination appointments, you may reschedule or cancel up
              to 24 hours before your scheduled time. Failure to do so will
              result in forfeiting your deposit, requiring a new deposit for any
              rescheduling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regarding Cosmetic Tattoo Appointments, please note that
              rescheduling or canceling requires a minimum 48-hour notice.
              Failure to provide adequate notice will result in the forfeiture
              of your booking deposit. Clients are responsible for reviewing our
              tattoo FAQs to ensure there are no contraindications that could
              prevent treatment on the scheduled day. Failure to do so may also
              result in forfeiture of your deposit.

              If you need to reschedule your appointment, you are welcome to do
              so! The deposit from the missed appointment will be applied to a
              future booking, with the remaining balance due upon scheduling the
              new appointment. Please ensure to reschedule at least 48 hours
              before your original appointment time to use the deposit for your
              rescheduled appointment automatically.

            <p>
              We understand that unexpected events can occur. However, to
              respect your artist and other scheduled clients, if you arrive 15
              minutes or later, your appointment and non-refundable deposit will
              be forfeited. Rescheduling will be necessary to avoid delays for
              subsequent clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that each procedure requires its allocated time to
              achieve optimal results; rushing is not possible. Depending on our

              <strong>NEW CLIENTS:</strong> Touch-ups are reserved exclusively
              for returning SEPIYAR clients. We do not provide touch-ups for
              work done by other artists at "touch-up" rates. If your initial
              service was performed by another artist elsewhere, you will be
              charged as a new client. Thank you for your understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>EXISTING CLIENTS:</strong> Future touch-ups cannot be

              Existing Permanent Makeup Policy
            </h4>
            <p>
              We do not offer reduced-fee touch-ups for cosmetic tattoos done by
              other artists, as correcting previous work often requires
              additional effort and expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
              For new clients seeking correction of a cosmetic tattoo done
              elsewhere, a consultation is typically necessary to assess
              feasibility. Please email us at{" "}
              <span className="text-pink-700 font-bold"> info@sepiyar.com</span>{" "}
              with a clear, makeup-free photo in natural light of the treated
              area. This allows our cosmetic tattoo artist to evaluate and
              determine the appropriate correction method before scheduling an
              appointment.
            </p>
            <p>
              At SEPIYAR, correction work typically involves two sessions: an
              initial session followed by an enhancement session 5-10 weeks
              later. Each appointment lasts approximately 1-2 hours to ensure
              meticulous work. Your enhancement session will be scheduled on the
              day of your initial session to allow your skin adequate time to
              heal and regenerate fully. Additional sessions may be needed at
              touch-up rates.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please be aware that in certain cases, correction may not be
              advisable, and laser removal could be recommended as an
              alternative solution. We are here to assist and welcome you as a
              new client if we can be of service.
