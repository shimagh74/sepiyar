        question: "What is permanent cosmetic makeup and tattooing?",
        answer: "Permanent cosmetic makeup, also known as cosmetic tattooing, is designed to be long-lasting. Procedures such as permanent eyebrows, eyeliner, and lip coloring are non-surgical and involve specialized tattooing techniques. Colored pigments are implanted into the skin's dermal layer through microscopic injections, using a state-of-the-art machine with a one-time-use cartridge system or a hand tool method. This method employs either a fine sterile disposable needle or a cluster of needles to create the appearance of hair strokes, makeup, or to enhance the face's natural features, providing a highly customized result.This procedure is also referred to as micropigmentation, intradermal cosmetics, dermal implantation, or dermagraphics. The term 'permanent makeup' describes the cosmetic tattooing of facial features—such as eyebrows, eyeliner, or lips—to improve their color and shape. Various methods are used to apply permanent cosmetics. This ancient practice, combined with modern application techniques, safely enhances the eyebrows, eyes, and lips with results that last, saving time on your daily beauty routine."

        question: "What does it cost?",
        answer: "Permanent cosmetics are not cheap, but they are invaluable. Most people opt for permanent makeup not to save money but for the convenience and assurance of always looking their best. When compared to non-surgical procedures like Botox or wrinkle fillers, which last only 3-4 months, permanent makeup offers years of benefits at a similar cost, saving time daily.We use top-notch equipment, sterile single-use materials, and high-quality pigments, reflected in the price. The long-lasting nature of these treatments makes them a cost-effective choice, providing peace of mind regarding health and safety. While some may seek the cheapest option, this often leads to unsatisfactory results that are hard and expensive to fix. It's essential to research your artist to ensure beautiful, natural results that enhance your features.",

    {
        question: "Is it same as a tattoo? Is it really Permanent?",
        answer: "Whenever color is implanted into the skin's dermis, it qualifies as a form of tattoo, regardless of the techniques and pigments used. Permanent cosmetics are deemed 'permanent' because the pigment is embedded in the upper reticular layer of the dermis and cannot be washed off. However, like any tattoo or pigment, fading can and often does occur, necessitating periodic maintenance, such as enhancements, touch-ups, color boosts, or refreshers.The science behind pigment fading and the need for touch-ups is comparable to tinted hair color, faded materials near windows, or house paint exposed to the sun and other environmental factors. Pigment in the skin may fade over time, and this periodic maintenance offers a chance to reassess and adjust color and design preferences.",

    {
        question: "What happens during a permanent cosmetic makeup session?",
        answer: "Each service will take up to approximately 2 hours and requires precise detail. Enhancement sessions usually take less time. Sara will review your client consent form and discuss your health and goals to ensure that cosmetic tattooing is right for you. Before photos/videos will be taken, and a pre-draw will be done to achieve the best look for you, considering shape, size, style, lifestyle, and other individual aspects. Paying close attention to your feedback, Sara will design and measure the specific golden ratio of your face using various precision tools.Once you approve the design, the color is carefully selected to match your natural hair color and skin tone. Pre-numbing cream is applied, and once the area is numb, it is removed, but the pre-draw remains in place. The procedure is then performed. Sara will review post-care instructions with you and provide post-care goodies. After photos/videos will be taken. An enhancement session will be booked for 8-12 weeks later to perfect your new tattooed area. The enhancement session is as important as the initial treatment, where the magic really happens, so don't miss it. ",
    }, 
    {
        question: "How many sessions until the final results?",
        answer: "All permanent cosmetic procedures require multiple sessions for optimal results. Clients are advised to return for one enhancement session approximately 8-12 weeks after the initial session. During the enhancement session, we assess color retention and make necessary adjustments based on individual healing processes, which vary from person to person and are influenced by post-care adherence.If your cosmetic tattoo doesn't heal perfectly the first time, there's no need to worry. We can deepen the color and add density during subsequent appointments. This session is also ideal for clients seeking a more dramatic look, though it's important to note that adding to permanent makeup is easier than removing it. The enhancement session is crucial for achieving the best possible outcome and should be completed within 2 months of your initial treatment. Depending on individual tissue reactions, some clients may require a third session, which may incur an additional cost. It's important to understand that permanent cosmetic tattoos require maintenance over time. Touch-ups are typically recommended every 12-18 months to maintain a fresh appearance. Results can vary and generally last between 1 to 4 years, influenced by individual maintenance routines and skin type.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "Can I have eyebrows , eyeliner and lips done on the same day?",
        answer: "Certainly, consolidating all your aftercare and healing time for multiple areas into one session is advantageous. However, some prefer to schedule procedures separately, focusing on brows and eyeliner first and returning for lips later, or vice versa. If you're interested in having all procedures done in one day, please contact us via phone or email to schedule an appointment.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "Do you shave off my existing eyebrow hair or eyebrow procedures?",
        answer: "Absolutely not. We always incorporate as much of your natural brow hairs as possible. There's no need to shave off your existing brow hair. Instead, we utilize your natural eyebrow hair and your unique brow bone structure as a guide and template. This approach helps us create natural-looking eyebrows that can instantly lift your eyes, define your face, and enhance your overall appearance by years",
    }, 
    {
        question: "Will I still need to tweeze?",
        answer: "Yes, permanent makeup will not interfere with your natural hair growth.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "What should I expect after the procedure?",
        answer: "After the procedure, you may notice a slight white residue from the numbing gel, which typically disappears within 15 to 30 minutes. Brows and eyeliner may appear darker immediately after the initial appointment, while lip colors may look more intense. The color will lighten within a couple of weeks and continue to lighten over several weeks. Most people can resume their daily routines. There may be mild swelling, redness, or tenderness lasting from a few hours to a few days (eyebrows tend to swell less than eyes and lips). Immediately after the procedure, slight bruising may occur, particularly with lip and eye procedures. It is crucial to follow the post-care instructions to ensure proper healing of your permanent cosmetic design. Approximately 6-8 weeks after your initial session, you will have an enhancement session where color and design adjustments can be made. This enhancement session is very important and required before concluding that your procedure is complete.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "Am I a good candidate for permanent cosmetic makeup?",
        answer: "You may not be an ideal candidate for permanent cosmetic procedures if you are under 18 years of age, currently ill (cold, flu, etc.), undergoing chemotherapy, have had an organ transplant, or have a history of trichotillomania. Skin irritations such as psoriasis, rashes, sunburn, acne, eczema, rosacea, or active cold sores near the treatment area could also disqualify you. Pregnant or nursing individuals are advised to wait until after childbirth and nursing due to potential risks. Use of Accutane, steroids, or Retin-A in recent months may affect skin healing. Long-term use of anticoagulants or medications affecting the dermal layer, allergies to makeup or pigments, autoimmune diseases, epilepsy, diabetes, hemophilia, heart disease, hepatitis, HIV, glaucoma, blood disorders, or certain heart conditions may require physician approval. Keloid or hypertrophic scarring tendencies, iron deficiency/anemia, and smoking can impact eligibility and may require additional considerations or clearances from your doctor.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "Why style of brow permanent cosmetic works best for me?",
        answer: "Microblading is suitable for dry to normal skin types with small pores. However, if you have oily skin, microblading may not be as effective. The hair strokes may heal with a diffused, softer appearance, resulting in a more powdered look than anticipated, due to the production of oil. For combination brow and ombre powder brow techniques, they are suitable for normal to oily skin types, accommodating small, medium, and large pores.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "Who benefits for permanents cosmetics?",
        answer: "Permanent cosmetics are ideal for individuals with allergies or skin sensitivities to traditional makeup. They save time and eliminate the worry about appearance during activities like sports, swimming, and sweating. This procedure is beneficial for alopecia sufferers, cancer patients, and those with trichotillomania or hair loss. It's recommended to undergo treatment before chemotherapy to align tattooed eyebrows with natural growth. Permanent makeup corrects asymmetrical facial features, offering convenience and freedom from daily makeup routines. It's perfect for those with physical limitations, burn survivors, athletes, and anyone seeking a permanent solution to smudging and fading. It defines eyebrows, enhances lip color, and provides smudge-free, waterproof eyeliner. This is particularly helpful for contact lens wearers, the vision-impaired, and those with dexterity issues like arthritis or Parkinson's disease. Permanent cosmetics ensure a consistent, great look 24/7, lasting for several years without washing off.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "Doest it hurt?",
        answer: "Although permanent cosmetics is a form of tattooing, the pain is generally less pronounced due to gentler and less invasive techniques. Clients typically report minimal discomfort. Numbing cream and topical anesthetics are applied before and during the procedure to ensure comfort. Pain tolerance varies among individuals, but most clients feel only pressure. Throughout the procedure, we will check in with you to ensure you are comfortable. Note that sensitivity may be higher during your menstrual cycle. The final results outweigh the brief discomfort, and most clients find the process well worth it.",

    {
        question: "What do I do after the procedure?",
        answer: "Follow id artsy post-care instructions",
    }, 
    {
        question: "What will eyeliner feel like?",
        answer: "You will feel vibrations but not discomfort. Sara’s gentle touch, precise technique, and effective numbing agents ensure your comfort throughout the process, which typically takes about an hour, depending on your specific needs.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "What is the healing process like?",
        answer: "Implanting pigment is seen by the body as trauma, causing increased blood flow to the area. During healing, the pigment will initially appear darker and then lighter. For brows, new skin cells can make the pigment look ashy, red, opaque, or grayish. For eyes, expect swelling and redness, which should subside in a few hours. Itching is normal. Use cold spoons on the eyelids to reduce swelling. Scabs fall off in about 4-5 days, with true color appearing around 4-6 weeks. For lips, the color may be up to 70% darker for the first few days with minimal swelling. The crust will flake away, revealing a lighter color. Many clients prefer a darker touch-up later. Full healing and true results are visible in about 28 days. Follow all post-procedure instructions to ensure proper healing. Patience is essential.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "Can poorly permanent cosmetics be fixed in color and shape?",
        answer: "In most cases, previous cosmetic tattoos can be corrected, but it's important to have realistic expectations as results may not match a fresh procedure. Poorly shaped or unnatural colors on your brows, eyeliner, or lips can often be fixed using corrective pigments. However, if the previous work is too dark, dense, discolored, or large, tattoo removal may be recommended before correction. We welcome new clients if we can help, but correction work starts at the new client rate, which includes two sessions (an initial session and one 6-8 weeks later). Each appointment lasts about 2 hours to ensure quality results. Additional touch-up sessions may be required. Sara does not offer reduced rates for touch-ups of other artists work due to the increased effort needed for correction. A consultation is often necessary to determine if correction is possible.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "How long does it take to heal?",
        answer: "The healing time for all treatments is generally minimal, typically up to 10 days. A small percentage of people may experience swelling, itchiness, and tenderness in the days following a treatment, but they can resume work and other activities immediately. Swelling can last up to 48 hours or slightly longer for lip liner + blend and full lip procedures, and the lips may become dry. Mature clients may find their lips sore and rough for about 7 days. Please note that we cannot perform lip treatments on individuals with dental braces.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "How long is the downtime?",
        answer: "All permanent cosmetics are walk-in, walk-out procedures with no downtime. Sara's techniques are non-invasive, causing very minimal trauma and allowing for little to no downtime. Many mistakenly believe they need to take time off work after the treatment, but this is not necessary; you can return to work immediately if you choose. However, if you plan to vacation, it's advisable to schedule your trip at least 14 days before or 4 weeks after the procedure.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "What will the final color look like?",
        answer: "Permanent cosmetic colors should complement a person’s skin tone, hair, and eye color. It's advisable to take a conservative approach because it's easier to darken an existing color than to lighten it. Immediately after a procedure, colors will appear darker and more intense, but they will gradually lighten and soften as they heal.",
    }, 
     
    {
        question: "Can I have permanent cosmetics performed while undergoing chemotherapy treatments?",
        answer: "We recommend completing these services before starting chemotherapy treatments. Chemotherapy weakens your immune system, raising concerns about performing procedures that carry infection risks during this time. Exceptions to this rule require written consent from your doctor.",
    }, 
     
    {
        question: "How does permanent makeup fades?",
        answer: "Several factors contribute to the fading of permanent makeup, including body chemistry, cellular turnover, anti-aging products applied over the makeup, the choice of color (lighter colors fade quicker), exposure to sunlight (SPF is recommended), and the technician's choice of pigment and experience.",
    }, 
     
    {
        question: "Can I wear makeup afterwards?",
        answer: "We recommend refraining from using traditional cosmetics until the skin has fully healed to avoid infection and ensure proper healing. Keep the treated area clean and lightly moisturized with the provided ointment to support efficient healing. After healing, you can resume wearing makeup as desired, although you may find that less makeup is necessary.",
    }, 
     
    {
        question: "Can I go on vacation immediately after my treatment?",
        answer: "Sun exposure can affect the success of your results during the initial healing phase. We recommend allowing 4-6 weeks between your final enhancement procedure and any planned vacation to ensure optimal healing.",
    }, 
     
    {
        question: "How long does permanent cosmetic makeup lasts?",
        answer: "Permanent cosmetic makeup procedures are designed to be long-lasting but will naturally fade over time, typically requiring touch-ups every 1-2 years, and 2-3 years for lips and eyes. Unlike traditional tattoos, pigments are not implanted as deeply, contributing to natural fading. Various factors influence color retention, such as the original shade, age, metabolism, skin type (normal, dry, oily), UV exposure, smoking, medications, and skincare products containing chemicals like AHA, glycolic acid, retinol, and hydroquinone. Individual skin characteristics affect pigment longevity, with touch-ups recommended every 12-18 months to maintain optimal appearance, though a faint shadow may persist over time.",

    {
        question: "Can I get tattooed if I am pregnant or nursing?",
        answer: "As a precaution, we do not perform cosmetic tattooing on women who are pregnant or nursing.",
    }, 
     
    {
        question: "What if I currently have lip fillers or plan to have them?",
        answer: "If you do not plan to continue with lip fillers over time, it's advisable to consider your lip procedure first. If you intend to maintain fillers, we can perform the procedure afterward, provided the fillers have settled adequately. We recommend waiting at least 6 weeks after filler injections. However, if you decide to discontinue fillers at any point, there is a risk that your lip line may appear slightly uneven. This concern should be addressed during your lip consultation.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "Can I get tattooed if I recently had botbox or other injectables?",
        answer: "As a precautionary measure, we do not perform cosmetic tattooing on individuals who have received Botox injections less than 14 days prior to their appointment. After the healing period, you can resume your Botox treatments as usual.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "I have suffered with cold sores in the past -will this effect my lip enhancement?",
        answer: "If you have a history of cold sores, fever blisters, sun blisters, or any other type of sore on your lips, undergoing the procedure may cause these sores to reactivate due to the trauma and stress involved. For optimal results, it is recommended to consult your doctor and obtain a prescription for antiviral medication such as Zovirax, Famvir, Valtrex, or similar tablets. The daily dosage should total 1000mg. Clients should begin taking the tablets two days before the lip procedure and continue for two days after the procedure.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "How will my cosmetic tattoo look in the future",
        answer: "Most of our clients' cosmetic tattoos maintain their color and naturally lighten over time. However, in some cases, colors may fade to different tones depending on individual responses to pigments, influenced by factors such as lifestyle and iron deficiencies. These changes are influenced by various factors. During your follow-up appointment, we will reassess how your body has reacted to the initial color. Any necessary adjustments to correct or prevent further color changes will be made with a special formula at this time.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "What should I know about long term care?",
        answer: "Your cosmetic tattoo will typically last between 1 to 3 years for brows and 2 to 5 years for lips and eyeliner after the enhancement session. Regular touch-up appointments are necessary to maintain shape and color depth. Without maintenance, the color will lighten over time. Fading depends significantly on skin type, lifestyle, sun exposure, pigment color used, broken capillaries, and iron deficiency. For optimal lip maintenance, we recommend scheduling a touch-up once a year. Daily sunscreen application on tattooed areas is essential to preserve color integrity, as sun exposure accelerates fading. This is especially important for smokers and those frequently exposed to sunlight. Using a lip balm with SPF daily also helps maintain lip tattoo color. Inform practitioners of any planned chemical peels or laser procedures, as these can affect your cosmetic tattoo. If you undergo an MRI scan after receiving permanent cosmetics, inform the practitioner beforehand about your treatment details. While this should not prevent you from having an MRI, it's crucial information for the practitioner. Regular use of retin-A/tretinoin, hydroquinone, or strong exfoliants near tattooed areas can prematurely fade your cosmetic tattoo. Additionally, avoid using exfoliating cleansers, scrubs, or products with acne-fighting ingredients near the tattooed area, as these can cause rapid pigment loss. Laser hair removal in tattooed areas should also be communicated to the technician beforehand to prevent unintended fading or color change of your cosmetic tattoo.",

    {
        question: "How hygienic is the procedure?",
        answer: "At Id Artsy, we prioritize cleanliness and hygiene, adhering to the highest standards of safety. We use only high-quality pigments, disposable needles, and single-use supplies for each client. All needles and attachments are sterile and disposed of after every treatment to ensure a safe procedure. We never reuse pigment between clients and always use new needles, machine attachments, and products. Our studio is approved by the local health department. Choosing a properly accredited venue is essential, as improper practices elsewhere can lead to poor results, permanent scarring, skin infections, or serious illnesses like hepatitis B and C due to inadequate needle cleaning.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "Are the pigments used on my skin safe?",
        answer: "Our pigment selections are of the highest grade and quality, undergoing strict testing and regulations. However, it's crucial to strictly follow post-care instructions to prevent bacterial infections. Technically, the colored pigments used are suspensions containing insoluble inert compounds, typically iron or titanium oxides. These microscopic particles, which may appear dissolved, are actually suspended in a clear liquid base of alcohol, distilled water, and glycerin. The traditional body tattooing process differs because it uses colored inks or dyes that are completely dissolved liquids with transparent color. While the pigments are generally considered safe, people can develop allergies to anything at any time; however, pigment allergies are rare. Some doctors recommend permanent cosmetic procedures for individuals with environmental or conventional makeup allergies because they can replace products that may cause sensitivity. Allergic reactions to tattooing pigments, whether on the body or face through permanent cosmetics, are extremely rare. Additionally, pigment suppliers are required to list ingredients on their labels, and the product ingredients are listed on the bottles we use.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "How do I know what color will look best on me?",
        answer: "It's important to be conservative when choosing colors for permanent cosmetics. It's easier to darken or add more color later than to remove if the result is too dark or unnatural. While you can provide input on color selection, there are many factors to consider. Lizzeth will assist you in this process. Everyone's skin has unique qualities, including tone and sensitivity, which impact color decisions. Understanding your underlying skin tone is crucial for achieving the desired healed and long-term color. Lizzeth has extensive knowledge of color theory and skin physiology, along with significant experience across various skin types.",

    {
        question: "How do I choose a professional permanent cosmetic artist?",
        answer: "Choosing a permanent makeup artist can be daunting, especially for first-timers. Take your time to find the right artist for you—don't base your decision solely on price. Research thoroughly. Look for an artist who is licensed, insured, and certified in their craft, with consistent and current work showcased. A skilled artist will gladly answer all your questions, demonstrating their expertise. Ensure the technician discusses potential outcomes of the procedure, showing they prioritize your well-being. Trust your instincts; only choose an artist who makes you feel relaxed and confident. Doing so ensures you've made an informed and comfortable choice.",

        question: "Can I have anti-aging injections or cosmetic surgery after my treatment?",

    }, 
    {
        question: "What do I need to know if I want to have a laser facial done after having permanent makeup?",
        answer: "You can undergo laser treatments like IPL for photodamage or Fraxel-type lasers for skin tightening and restoration, but it's crucial to inform the medical professional about your permanent cosmetic tattoo. They should apply 20% zinc oxide to protect the tattoo. Certain colors may change undesirably or lighten under laser treatment. It's important that the laser doesn't directly contact the areas with permanent cosmetics.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "What if style changes?",
        answer: "We avoid following trends in our work. For instance, if you choose to wear a different lip liner or lipstick color, it will dominate over your permanent cosmetic color.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "Will you add a wing to my top eyeliner?",
        answer: "We can do this, but only after discussing the long-term implications with you. Eyeliner trends may not age well over time. Eyes change significantly as we age; what looks lifted and beautiful now may eventually droop or appear misshapen. Permanent color can remain in your skin, so we typically recommend a natural eyeliner that enhances your eye shape. We can often achieve a subtle lift to the outer corners.",
    }, 
    {
        question: "Can someone donate blood after the procedure?",
        answer: "The Red Cross blood donation eligibility guidelines state that donors must discuss their health history before donating blood. They deem tattoos acceptable if applied by a state-regulated entity using sterile equipment and ink that is not reused. Current FDA guidelines defer donation for 12 months after a tattoo. However, individuals tattooed within the last 12 months can donate if the tattoo was done by a state-regulated entity using sterile equipment and non-reused ink.",
