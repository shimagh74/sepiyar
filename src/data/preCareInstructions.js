  "On Days 1 to 2, your eyes may appear swollen and slightly crusty upon waking. Swelling should diminish with upright positioning, blinking, and increased circulation to the area. Avoid heavy lifting, exertion, and crying.",
  "By Day 2, swelling should reduce, but the area may feel tight and sore if touched.",
  "From Day 3 to 4, the top layer of skin may begin to flake in small, stitch-like lines, although not everyone notices this exfoliation. **Do not pick at it**, as this may pull out pigment and result in uneven color. Blinking helps remove detached pigment pieces.",
