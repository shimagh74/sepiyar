      "review": "I recently had the pleasure of getting a combination brows tattoo done by Sepi, and I couldn't be happier with the results! From start to finish, the experience was exceptional. Sepi took the time to listen to my preferences and provided valuable insights to ensure the final look was perfect. The attention to detail and precision in their work is truly remarkable. The combination brows look incredibly natural and have transformed my appearance, giving me the confidence I was looking for. The entire process was smooth, professional, and surprisingly comfortable.I highly recommend Sepiyar to anyone considering getting their brows done. Their expertise and artistry are unparalleled, and the results speak for themselves. Thank you, Sepi, for your outstanding work!",

      "review": "When Sepi approached me to have an eyelash enhancement cosmetic tattoo I didn't really realise how much it was going to enhance my eyes nor my lashes. Talented, careful and informative Sepi explained step by step what was about to happen. To my delight my eyes forever more will look great whenever I can't be bothered wearing makeup. Its wonderful to step out of the shower and catch yourself in the mirror and look great! The procedure took about 2 hours and through the use of numbing cream it was a little uncomfortable but not painful. A few weeks later I had a lash lift to complete the transformation of my eyes. So happy, highly recommended if you would like your eyes to have more shape and definition.",
